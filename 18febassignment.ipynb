    "(Representational State Transfer) API Python framework is a set of utilities based on\n",
    "werkzeug to easily build Restful API. It is easy to configure and extends with ease. \n",
    "It does not decide how the data can be rendered, nor any other decision. Instead,\n",
    "it’s an easily extensible architecture to build one’s API\n",
    "an API acts as a communication layer, or as the name says, an interface, that allows \n",
    "different systems to talk to\n",
    "each other without having to understand exactly what each other does. APIs can come\n",
    "in many forms or shapes\n",

    "main advantage of providing an API is that it allows your users to do more with your \n",
    "product or service (i.e. it increases the value of your product).\n",
    "This typically takes one of two forms -\n",
    "\n",
    "an integration. An example of an integration is to push notifications from your product \n",
    "(such as CRM, Helpdesk) to a messaging tool such as Slack. In this way, if your customer\n",
    "uses Slack they can receive notifications without having to login directly to your system \n",
    "or check emails.\n",
    "new functionality. In the early days of Twitter, some of the most popular Twitter clients\n",
    "were produced by third parties using the Twitter API. Twitter and its users benefited from \n",
    "the new functionality that was undertaken by other companies.\n",
    "The disadvantages to providing an API are,\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost. Providing an API is expensive in terms of development time, ongoing maintenance,\n",
    "providing API documentation on your website and providing support to users of your API.\n",
    "Security exposure. Adding an API adds another attack surface to your website.\n",
    "You might not like the result or you may change business direction. It's not always easy\n",
    "to predict exactly how your API will be used. If your integration with a messaging system\n",
    "means that users login to your service less often, will there be an overall negative impact \n",
    "for you? Withdrawing\n",
    "an API can be painful for users if you decide that you need to do so. This is unusual \n",
    "but it can happen. \n",

    "functionality of a web browser. A Server API can extend the functionality of a web server.\n",
    "Both APIs and web services are technologies that enable the transfer of data between separate\n",
    "software applications. API is an interface that exposes an application's\n",
    "data to outside software, whereas web applications are one type of API with stricter requirements.\n",

    "ans-REST is a set of guidelines that offers flexible implementation,\n",

    "and serverless computing.\n",
    "SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for\n",
    "Representational State Transfer.\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern.\n",
    "SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications \n",
    "while REST uses Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device.\n",
    "SOAP needs more bandwidth for its usage whereas REST doesn’t need much bandwidth.\n",
    "Comparing SOAP vs REST API, SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with\n",
