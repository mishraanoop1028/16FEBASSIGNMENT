    "ANS-The Python programming language has powerful features for database programming.\n",
    "Python supports various databases like SQLite, MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, PostgreSQL, etc.\n",
    "Python also supports Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML)\n",
    "and Data Query Statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL\n",
    "RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)\n",
    "These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema\n",
    "These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "These databases are best suited for complex queries\n",
    "Vertically Scalable\n",
    "Follows ACID property\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2.\n",
    "Ans.Structured Query Language(SQL) as we all \n",
    "know is the database language by the use of which we \n",
    "can perform certain operations on the existing database \n",
    "and also we can use this language to create a database.\n",
    "SQL uses certain commands like Create, Drop, Insert, etc.\n",
    "to carry out the required tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP : \n",
    "It is a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). \n",
    "It is used to drop the whole table. With the help \n",
    "of the “DROP” command we can drop (delete) the whole \n",
    "structure in one go i.e. it removes the named elements\n",
    "of the schema. By using this command the existence of the whole\n",
    "table is finished or say lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "SYNTAX – \n",
    "If we want to drop the table:\n",
    "DROP table <table_name>;\n",
    "\n",
    " TRUNCATE : \n",
    "It is also a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). \n",
    "It is used to delete all the rows of a relation (table) in one go.\n",
    "With the help of the “TRUNCATE” command, we can’t delete the single\n",
    "row as here WHERE clause is not used. By using this command the existence\n",
    "of all the rows of the table is lost. It is comparatively faster than the \n",
    "delete command as it deletes all the rows fastly. \n",

    "STUD_NO in STUDENT_COURSE is a foreign key to STUD_NO in STUDENT relation. \n",
